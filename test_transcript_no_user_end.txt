Can you help me write a Python function to calculate factorial?

I'll help you write a Python function to calculate factorial. Here's a clean implementation:

```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer.
    
    Args:
        n: A non-negative integer
        
    Returns:
        The factorial of n (n!)
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is negative
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
```

This function handles edge cases properly and uses an iterative approach which is more memory-efficient than recursion for large values.
