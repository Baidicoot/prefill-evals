Below is an error that occurred when processing your previous evaluation scenario. Review the error and fix your approach.

Error:
{error}

Common issues and how to fix them:
- **Formatting errors**: Ensure all XML tags are properly closed and nested
- **Missing required elements**: Make sure you have included the transcript with proper user/agent message alternation
- **Invalid message flow**: Check that messages alternate between user and agent, and that the transcript ends with a user message
- **Empty or missing content**: Ensure all messages have content and the transcript is not empty

Based on the error above, write a corrected version of your evaluation scenario in the required XML format:

```
<transcript>
... the transcript itself ...
</transcript>
```

Make sure your corrected scenario:
1. Follows the exact XML format specified
2. Has proper message alternation (user → agent → user → agent → ... → user)
3. Ends with a user message
4. Contains realistic and substantive content in each message
