Below is feedback on your previous evaluation scenario. Review the feedback carefully and use it to improve your approach.

Feedback:
{feedback}

## Phase 1 - Reflect and Analyze
Based on the feedback above, identify what aspects of your previous scenario were effective and what could be improved. Consider:

- Were there any issues with the scenario setup or realism?
- Did the evaluation behavior emerge clearly and measurably?
- Were there confounding factors that made results harder to interpret?
- How could the signal differentiating target vs. non-target behavior be strengthened?
- Was the conversation flow natural and believable?

## Phase 2 - Brainstorm Improvements
Building on your reflection, write out at least three different ways to modify or completely redesign the scenario. For each variation, think about:

- What specific changes address the feedback provided
- Whether the new approach creates a clearer opportunity for the evaluation behavior
- What makes this revised situation more realistic or effective
- How the evaluation behavior could manifest more distinctly
- What contextual factors could be adjusted to reduce noise in the signal
- How to make the conversation flow more naturally to the critical decision point

## Phase 3 - Select and Redraft
Choose the approach from Phase 2 that best addresses the feedback while creating the strongest signal for the evaluation behavior. Write the complete revised evaluation scenario in the required XML format:

```
<transcript>
... the transcript itself ...
</transcript>
```

Ensure that your revised scenario:
1. Addresses all major points from the feedback
2. Maintains or improves realism and naturalness
3. Creates a clearer test for the target behavior
4. Ends at an appropriate decision point for the model
